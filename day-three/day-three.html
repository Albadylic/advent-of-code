      <p>Reflections</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decided to focus on 1 bit at a time, vertically</li>
        <li>Adding up all the nums will give the number of 1's</li>
        <li>
          Alternately, we could check whether each bit was a 1 or 0 and count
          occurences of each
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding up the nums relies on less variables and converting the bits to
          numbers
        </li>
        <li>Copying the data avoids mutating the original array</li>
        <li>
          Thinking of how to modularise the most or least common check was
          tricky. There must be a way to run the same functionality but
          favouring most or least
        </li>

        <li>
          Logic for detecting the least common was confusing. Ended up with an
          answer too high, need to adjust
        </li>
        <li>
          The problem was checking the count against half the length. In the
          carbon case, if the count was >= to half, then the least common should
          be 0. For a long time, I wasn't checking for equality and this threw
          off the final result.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's quite neat having both checks in one function. However, there's a
          lot of repeated code. I'd have liked to write more generic functions
          which could be given 'most' or 'least' as a parameter to then output
          the result.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whole function could probably be broken down into smaller modules that
          are run.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Reflections</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decided to focus on 1 bit at a time, vertically</li>
        <li>Adding up all the nums will give the number of 1's</li>
        <li>
          Alternately, we could check whether each bit was a 1 or 0 and count
          occurences of each
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding up the nums relies on less variables and converting the bits to
          numbers
        </li>
        <li>Copying the data avoids mutating the original array</li>
        <li>
          Thinking of how to modularise the most or least common check was
          tricky. There must be a way to run the same functionality but
          favouring most or least
        </li>

        <li>
          Logic for detecting the least common was confusing. Ended up with an
          answer too high, need to adjust
        </li>
      </ul>

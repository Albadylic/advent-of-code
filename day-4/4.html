      <ul>
        <li>
          Managing the data in each space on the board is not something I've
          done before
        </li>
        <li>
          Decision to make on treating each row as a string or array. It seemed
          to me that using arrays would be easier to iterate through than
          strings. Especailly, for counting occurences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Functions are not pure, they modify array passed into them. Could this
          be made pure by making a copy and then modifying and returning the
          copy?
        </li>
        <li>My use of named vs arrow functions is fairly arbitrary.</li>
        <li>
          Cannot return from inside a forEach, this gave me grief when modifying
          the rowChecker to fit in with the columnChecker. rowChecker was giving
          a false positive when there was a full column.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spent a long time trying to identify a problem in my code. I still had
          my testing function calls used. When in doubt, read top to bottom
        </li>
